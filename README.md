trinity-extra-theme - trinitize look and feel of various apps
=============================================================
trinity-extra-theme contains configuration files for various software.
The purpose of these files is to approximate the look and feel of the
[trinity-gtk-theme](https://github.com/zeppe-lin/trinity-gtk-theme).


Install
-------
The various software have their own configuration files location.  See
the corresponding paths of your favorite program and check if it has
trinitized version, then replace it or adjust conform your needs.

Also, see `Makefile`.  I've added `import-local` target to sync local
and git configuration files.
